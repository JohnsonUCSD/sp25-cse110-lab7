## Check Your Understanding
1. I would pick 1, which is within a Github action whenever code is pushes. I would pick this because runnning tests whenever I push will constantly run those automated tests. If I push and the automated tests fail, I know that I have done something wrong and can go back to fix what broke it. It will be able to catch bugs while I work on my code.
2. No, I would not use an end to end test to check if a function is returning the correct output. E2E testing isn't used for testing specific functions, but rather user actions from start to finish.
