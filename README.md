## Check Your Understanding
1. I would pick 1, which is within a Github action whenever code is pushes. I would pick this because runnning tests whenever I push will constantly run those automated tests. If I push and the automated tests fail, I know that I have done something wrong and can go back to fix what broke it. It will be able to catch bugs while I work on my code.
2. No, I would not use an end to end test to check if a function is returning the correct output. E2E testing isn't used for testing specific functions, but rather user actions from start to finish.
3. The difference between navigation and snapshot mode is that in navigation mode, it will analyze a single page load and is used for overall performance, while for snapshot mode it will analyze the page in its current state for accessibility issues.
4. Using newer image formats such as WebP and AVIF instead of jpg to save space, properly sizing images to save data and improve load times, and adding a viewport meta tag to optimze app for mobile and prevent 300ms delay to user input.
